# Boid Simulation

This is a simple implentation of a Boid simulation in C++ with SFML. The boid algorthim was originally designed by Craig Reynolds, and simulates the flocking behaviour of birds.

This is another random Cellular Automata that caught my attention this summer. Pretty interesting program and cool to watch.

## Features

- **Spawning**: Boids are spawned on mouse click and move randomly
- **Flocking autonomy**: Each boid follows simple rules to steer its movement depending on the boids around it.

## Usage

    Click - Spawn boid
    Escape - Exit
